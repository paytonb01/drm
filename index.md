Have any of you seen something like that before? Well, this is an example of DRM, or Digital Rights Management. It was created as a way to limit piracy in the early 80s, and has become common since.

# So how does it work?

Every major DRM method works differently, but nowadays, they generally work by simply checking your account to see if you own the game. In theory, this is enough, and it doesn't impact the customer experience much. However, pirates are clever. They can easily patch this out quite fast. This got many developers desperate to keep the legitimate way the only way to access their content. However, this battle has easily gone too far.

# Harming the consumer

Throughout time, technology has evolved. But early in the gaming scene, it was simple. Games were either on cartridges built for a console, or on small drives known as floppy drives. This technology was early, and had no methods of checking if your game was the original. You could simply copy pc games from one floppy to another, and get two games out of it. Back then, the only feasible option was having something else to authenticate. Some games used little "code wheels" and regularly interrupted gameplay to ask you to input a code from the wheel. Another way was to have codes hidden in the manual. A couple games even had a device plug into a joystick port on your computer. At the time, this was the only way to check your game.

In the 90s, optical disks became common. At first, this worked great. CD burners were expensive, and buying the game was easier than pirating it. However, many pirates managed to rip files off the disks, and distribute them on early BBS networks, or as you may know it, the beginnings of the internet. So, developers had to start thinking differently. Enter StarForce. StarForce was a DRM method that ran in Windows, which games could simply check for while running. Great in theory, right?
Here's where it all went wrong. You see, Windows has a couple "ring levels". Essentially, this is a way of determining what permissions a program needs to run at to work. They ran on a priority system, with 0 being full read/write access, and higher numbers being more user-level access. Did you spot the problem there? Ring 0 is extremely dangerous to use, so usually only really important files live there, like Windows, drivers, and your boot sector, which is needed for Windows to run. But why bring this up now?
StarForce ran at ring 0. It had full read/write access over your computer. The outcome of this was predictable to those who knew about it. When uninstalling StarForce, some users began having issues. Sometimes Windows would act weird, sometimes you would need to reinstall drivers, and, as it turns out, you could lose your boot sector, effectively turning your computer into a brick unless you had access to another copy of Windows on a CD, or you took it to a repair shop.

Now let's move to the 2000s. StarForce was bankrupt, as you could imagine, since it literally broke people's computers. However, EA was releasing a new game, called Spore. This game was fairly successful, but it included an early attempt at online DRM. Sounds great, until you figure out that once the Spore servers go down, your game becomes unplayable. Additionally, in the 2000s, the internet was still very early in its development. If your internet was down, you couldn't play. If you were traveling, you couldn't play. This is an obvious problem that wouldn't be fixed for a long time.
Now let's talk consoles. You may be thinking, "I'm a console player, this is all PC stuff!" Well, this changed quite a bit, with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. All the prior consoles were fairly easy to pirate on. You could trick cartridge based systems into loading from an SD card, you could burn DVD-Rs and play them in modded systems, and you could even use an emulator to run older console games on a PC. This is no longer the case, for the most part. The Xbox 360 had something known as a hypervisor, which would scan the system for any unusual activity, such as modified firmware patches. The PlayStation had something similar. These two systems were tough to crack. The Xbox literally needed to be cracked. You had to drill into the CPU before the process was refined to a chip soldered onto the console. However, in the end, the pirates prevailed. Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo would begin to search for the ultimate DRM solution.
