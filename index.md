Have any of you seen something like that before? Well, this is an example of DRM, or Digital Rights Management. It was created as a way to limit piracy in the early 80s, and has become common since.

# So how does it work?

Every major DRM method works differently, but nowadays, they generally work by simply checking your account to see if you own the game. In theory, this is enough, and it doesn't impact the customer experience much. However, pirates are clever. They can easily patch this out quite fast. This got many developers desperate to keep the legitimate way the only way to access their content. However, this battle has easily gone too far.

# Harming the consumer

Throughout time, technology has evolved. But early in the gaming scene, it was simple. Games were either on cartridges built for a console, or on small drives known as floppy drives. This technology was early, and had no methods of checking if your game was the original. You could simply copy pc games from one floppy to another, and get two games out of it. Back then, the only feasible option was having something else to authenticate. Some games used little "code wheels" and regularly interrupted gameplay to ask you to input a code from the wheel. Another way was to have codes hidden in the manual. A couple games even had a device plug into a joystick port on your computer. At the time, this was the only way to check your game.

In the 90s, optical disks became common. At first, this worked great. CD burners were expensive, and buying the game was easier than pirating it. However, many pirates managed to rip files off the disks, and distribute them on early BBS networks, or as you may know it, the beginnings of the internet. So, developers had to start thinking differently. Enter StarForce. StarForce was a DRM method that ran in Windows, which games could simply check for while running. Great in theory, right?
Here's where it all went wrong. You see, Windows has a couple "ring levels". Essentially, this is a way of determining what permissions a program needs to run at to work. They ran on a priority system, with 0 being full read/write access, and higher numbers being more user-level access. Did you spot the problem there? Ring 0 is extremely dangerous to use, so usually only really important files live there, like Windows, drivers, and your boot sector, which is needed for Windows to run. But why bring this up now?
StarForce ran at ring 0. It had full read/write access over your computer. The outcome of this was predictable to those who knew about it. When uninstalling StarForce, some users began having issues. Sometimes Windows would act weird, sometimes you would need to reinstall drivers, and, as it turns out, it could cause an optical drive failure, or allow viruses to take over the DRM and get ring 0 control over your entire computer.

Now let's move to the 2000s. StarForce was not doing well, as you could imagine, since it literally broke people's computers. However, EA was releasing a new game, called Spore. This game was fairly successful, but it included an early attempt at online DRM. Sounds great, until you figure out that once the Spore servers go down, your game becomes unplayable. Additionally, in the 2000s, the internet was still very early in its development. If your internet was down, you couldn't play. If you were traveling, you couldn't play. This is an obvious problem that wouldn't be fixed for a long time.
Now let's talk consoles. You may be thinking, "I'm a console player, this is all PC stuff!" Well, this changed quite a bit, with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. All the prior consoles were fairly easy to pirate on. You could trick cartridge based systems into loading from an SD card, you could burn DVD-Rs and play them in modded systems, and you could even use an emulator to run older console games on a PC. This is no longer the case, for the most part. The Xbox 360 had something known as a hypervisor, which would scan the system for any unusual activity, such as modified firmware patches. The PlayStation had something similar. These two systems were tough to crack. The Xbox literally needed to be cracked. You had to drill into the CPU before the process was refined to a chip soldered onto the console. However, in the end, the pirates prevailed. Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo would begin to search for the ultimate DRM solution.

The 2010s were a very reformative time for the gaming industry. The Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and a few Nintendo consoles released. On the PC side, online game markets such as Steam and Epic Games Store became common. All of this lead to digital titles becoming the dominant method of buying games. This is where things get a little problematic for the consumer.
In January 30, 2019, the first major online store shutdown occured. The Wii Shop Channel permanently closed, making there be no legal way to acquire most of the exclusive titles. If not for the piracy community, this collection would likely be lost forever. This marks a large change for this community, as it is also for preservation purposes, rather than just getting free games. However, the video game market, and the software market as a whole, had no plans of stopping.

In the 2010s, Nintendo would begin banning modded consoles from online services, making there be no legal way to acquire digital only titles on those systems. Adobe made their products require internet to function. Some PC developers began making online DRM commonplace, a notorious example being Rockstar Games, having every game that uses the Rockstar launcher become unavailable during server maintenance.
This is also the beginning of a similar technology, anticheat. There are two types of anticheat, client (consumer) side, and server side. Client side runs on the system running the game, and server side runs on the game servers. So, which one is more secure? Well, that's not the only concern of the online game industry. Client side is less secure, as you can simply patch it out and cheat as much as you want. However, it is cheaper, as it doesn't take up server resources. Server side is the opposite. It is not possible to tamper with, due to being out of reach, but it also stresses the servers more, making it cost more. The industry's choice was client side, but they were unsatisfied with its security. Due to this, they began moving it out of the user's permissions. That's right, ring 0 is back with a vengeance. This results in a very strict anticheat, which also has the capability of breaking a computer. 
These two technologies have only been made commonplace on Windows, creating an effective monopoly in the PC gaming industry, and cutting out Macs and Linux computers, though the latter would not have a major impact for a while.

Here we are, in the 2020s. And here is that Linux impact.
Earlier this year, a new console called the Steam Deck launched. It boasts powerful hardware, in a handheld device, with a light operating system to give it performance and battery life. This operating system? Linux. This system has the goal of 100% compatibility with the entire Steam library. Sounds nice, but in practice, this is almost impossible, due to our old friends DRM and anticheat. Due to their all being ring 0, they have to run right next to a Windows operating system. However, this is not Windows. Over years, a community has gathered to get Windows programs onto Linux, Mac and FreeBSD operating systems. Problem is, this is really difficult. It's a lot like Apple's Rosetta system to run x86 applications on ARM processors. Great, but it has a heavy performance impact, even if you can get everything running, which has not been achieved with over 10 years of work by thousands of contributors and several corporations.

Valve, the creator of the Steam Deck, has created tools for anticheat to run through their Proton compatibility layer, however, it is up to developers to implement. How is this working out? Well, of the 215 anticheat games listed on ProtonDB, the website recording compatibility of the entire Steam library with Proton, only 19 non-native games are recorded as Deck Verified, an official designation by Valve indicating a game runs on the Deck. This means only 19 anticheat games are verified as functional. All this hassle, just because a game developer decided that server-side anticheat was too expensive.

And this brings us to the example at the beginning - Gran Turismo 7. Now, you may be thinking, "This is probably just to prevent cheating, right?" Well, Gran Turismo 7 is a singleplayer game. What would there be to gain?

# "But it stops piracy and cheating, right?"

Well, here's the thing. What would you do if you had a choice between buying a game that regularly has issues and breaks your computer, and downloading it for free and having it simply work, better than the official way. However, don't take my word for it. There's a brilliant example out there.
Resident Evil: Village was a highly anticipated game. Due to its graphics, people wanted to get it on pc to  use the highest settings they could. But what do you do when the game runs worse on better hardware? That's right, this game ran worse on PC than on consoles.
https://min.news/en/game/27683ca876596e6498300c79f05574ac.html
But why? The hardware was clearly better, right? Yes, but the software wasn't. The game's DRM, by Empress, caused massive stuttering and problematic performance on PC.
And how could we forget Rockstar Games? If you have ever played GTA Online, especially on PC, you may have noticed a large number of cheaters. However, the game has some fairly strict anticheat. Oh wait, it's client side. Once there is a method to bypass it, it's over. Any update you make, the cheaters will discover, and fix their cheats. Anything short of a complete re-engineering of the anticheat would be in vain.

This anticheat system is so easy to bypass, efforts to make detection easier simply result in false positives, from innocent players.
Oh, what about DRM? That's gotta stop the pirates, right? Wrong. In fact, according to this database https://gamestatus.info/?lg=en, most new games are cracked on day one.
A pattern with these is that once the piracy method is either easier, better, or the only way, it takes a lot longer to crack, since there is little motivation to do so. On the Xbox One, up until recently, you could put your console in dev mode and run your own programs on it, and Microsoft even profited from it, due to the payment requirement.

Note - Homebrew refers to "home-brewed code" or just third party applications on a system not designed to run those.

Another example of this is the digital music crash of the early 2000s. Mp3 players commonly used DRM protected music. This meant that if you bought music on another platform, or even on a CD or cassette, you would not be able to load it. This caused a huge crash in the sales of digital music, with people relying on CDs, cassettes, or even vinyl for their music collections. However, when Apple's iPod launched, people discovered iTunes had no DRM at all. You could dump CDs, buy mp3s, and even listen to them in the app. You could, and still can, simply download mp3 files and load them onto an iPod. For a point of comparison, look at Microsoft's Zune. It used DRM protected music, and it was a massive failure, despite being just as smart as an iPod. To this day, the DRM-free iPod is the most successful mp3 player of all time, excluding smartphones and computers.

## Conclusion

DRM has no place in the market. A game store can function just fine without it, in fact. Just look at https://gog.com. This store sells DRM-free games, and as it's still in business, it's clearly successful.
As a resilt, DRM is anti-consumer, needless, and destructive, as well as client-side anticheat.
